Logic:

Initialization:

Set three counters to zero:
sentenceLength to keep track of the total characters.
wordCount to keep track of the number of words.
vowelCount to keep track of the number of vowels.
Set a flag inWord to false, indicating we're not currently inside a word.
Iterate through each character of the sentence:

For each character:
Increment sentenceLength.
Check if the character is a space, punctuation mark, or a period:
If yes, set inWord to false (end of a word).
Otherwise (not a space/punctuation/period):
Check if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U):
If yes, increment vowelCount.
If the character is not a space/punctuation/period and inWord is false:
This means we're entering a new word. Set inWord to true.
If the character is not a space/punctuation/period and inWord is already true:
We're still within the same word. Do nothing.
Check if we're at the end of the sentence (encountered a period):
If yes, stop iterating (reached the end).

Word count handling:

Outside the loop, if inWord is true after iterating through the entire sentence, it means the last character was part of a word.
In this case, increment wordCount by 1 to account for the last word.

Output:

Return the values of the three counters: sentenceLength, wordCount, and vowelCount.
